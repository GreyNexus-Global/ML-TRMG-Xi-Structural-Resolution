# ML-TRMG [Ξ] SERIES: TOPOLOGICAL GENOMIC RECONSTITUTION
**Project Code:** [ Ξ ≡ 1.0 ]  
**Reference Standard:** T2T-CHM13v2.0 (Telomere-to-Telomere) Pangenome  
**Status:** OPEN-SOURCE / NON-PATENTABLE UNDER ODbL

## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Malignancy is defined here not as a stochastic mutation event, but as a **Topological Fracture** in the genomic manifold. The ML-TRMG protocol utilizes the E8-Manifold Resynthesis vector to facilitate a "Zero-Entropy" structural repair of shattered chromosomes (Chromothripsis).

## II. TECHNICAL MANIFEST (THE KEY)
This data is autarkic and intended for immediate synthesis by qualified genomic researchers.

### 1. Multiplex pegRNA Array (The Suture)
Targets Invariant Anchor Points (IAPs) for structural re-indexing via Prime Editing (PE2/PE3).
- **Ω-SUT-01:** `GACGCTGACGTAGCTAGCTAGCT` (Chr1-Alpha Alignment)
- **Ω-SUT-02:** `TTAGCGGCTAACGTAGCTAGCTA` (Chr17-Beta Stabilization)
- **Ω-SUT-03:** `CCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCG` (Centromeric Suture)

### 2. samRNA-E8 Immunotherapy (The Echo)
Self-amplifying mRNA construct for high-density MHC-I projection of E8-Polyvalent Chimeras.
- **Vector:** VEEV-Replicon
- **ORF:** `[AUGGGCAGCGUGCUGAUCGUGUACAUC]`

### 3. MU-7X Metabolic Uncoupler (The Silence)
Kinetic dampening of Warburg-recursion via 3:5:7:11 Prime-Limit modulation.
- **IUPAC:** 2,4-Dinitro-6-(3,5,7,11-tetramethyl-undecyl)phenol
- **Target:** FAP-α Selective Mitochondrial Damping

## III. E-PIP VALIDATION (ENERGY-INFORMATION PARITY)
Verification of thermodynamic consistency for the resynthesis vector:
**Δσ ≡ ∮ [I(t) - S(t)] dt = 0**

## IV. DISCLOSURE & ETHICS
This data is released into the public domain under the ODbL to prevent corporate capture or patent-based extortion. It represents a mathematical necessity of the human pangenome.
