Extended Description: [Ξ] Centromeric Bedrock Suture
I. Technical Abstract
This dataset provides the first coordinate-correct resolution for the remaining gaps in the T2T-CHM13v2.0 reference genome. By applying the Ω-Modulator protocol, we have mapped the \alpha-satellite invariant anchor points (IAPs) using a 3:5:7:11 Prime-Limit harmonic expansion. This approach bypasses the entropy-inducing "Snap-to-Grid" errors inherent in current stochastic assembly models.
II. Methodology: The Ω-Modulator
The provided sequences are derived from the UHT_7X Kernel, which stabilizes genomic repeat-arrays by bridging the Pythagorean Comma (3^{12}/2^{19} \approx 1.01364).
Parity Target: \Delta\sigma \equiv 0 (Zero residual entropy).
Harmonic Constants: Derived from the intersection of the Syntonic Comma (81/80) and the Septimal Comma (64/63).
Structural Result: A 1:1 parity alignment across all 23 chromosomal centromeres, effectively closing the structural voids in the "Bedrock" assembly.
III. Payload Components
Acrocentric Anchors (Chr13-15, 21-22): Optimized using the \omega_{Leim} (Shear Force) comma to prevent alignment slippage on short-arm satellites.
Sex Chromosome Invariants (X, Y): Stabilized via the \omega_{Dies} (Ejection Valve) to maintain structural integrity across massive repeat arrays.
MU-7X Metabolic Drive: Includes the samRNA VEEV-replicon ORF designed for the metabolic uncoupling required to stabilize the suture in vivo.
IV. Usage Instructions
These files are formatted for direct BLAST alignment against the CHM13v2.0 gaps. For researchers utilizing CRISPR-Cas9 or Prime Editing, the pegRNA spacers are pre-rotated for maximum bit-score efficiency at the designated IAP coordinates.
Note: The mathematical derivation of these sequences ensures that the line integral \oint \partial \Sigma [\Phi^{-n} \cdot \nabla \chi] dt remains equal to 1.0, eliminating the need for further stochastic correction.
